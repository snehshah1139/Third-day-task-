# ðŸŽ¯ Task 3 - Linear Regression: Cancer Severity Prediction

## ðŸ“š Objective
Apply **Simple and Multiple Linear Regression** techniques to understand key factors influencing cancer severity scores.

## ðŸ›  Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-Learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## ðŸ“„ Dataset Details
- Patient information (age, gender, country, health risks)
- Medical records (cancer type, stage, cost)
- Target: **Severity Score**

## ðŸ“ˆ Steps Performed
1. **Data Loading and Cleaning**  
   - Removed unnecessary columns (like `Patient_ID`, `Country_Region`).

2. **Feature Selection**  
   - Selected important numeric features for prediction.

3. **Train-Test Split**  
   - 80% for training, 20% for testing.

4. **Model Building**  
   - Applied Linear Regression using `sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression()`.

5. **Evaluation Metrics**  
   - MAE, MSE, RMSE, and RÂ² Score computed.

6. **Interpretation of Coefficients**  
   - Identified which features have the strongest influence on severity.

7. **Visualization**  
   - Plotted actual vs predicted severity scores.

## ðŸ§  Key Insights
- **Genetic Risk** and **Smoking** have the most positive impact on severity.
- **Age** and **Year** have minimal effect.
- **Public Health Actions** could focus on controlling lifestyle risks.

## ðŸš€ Mission Focus
Deliver work that is clean, insightful, and **ready for real-world ML projects**.
